Hey, kids.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.040
Let's huddle up and do a 
proactive deep dive into the

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:10.620
synergies of the big picture

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.820
economic policies of early 
British influence on the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.580
Canadian can-do attitudes

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.080
circa 1860 through 1870.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.695
I hope you have your
elevator pitches ready?

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:36.435

Shocking!  

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:47.305
Oh no,
A support ticket just came in.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.190
I need to helicopter in on that and value
add a strategic alignment action item.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.790
Got to keep those metrics incentivized.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.280
Yay.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.880
Yay, yay!

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.880
Collaboration!
